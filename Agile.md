# Agile

```
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile is a project management method, often associated with code development, that entails the taking in a problem, analyzing it, developing a multi-step plan or a set of connected plans, compensating for setbacks, testing, release, maintenance, and eventually retirement.<br>

    <span>Agile development is split into multiple sprints, each consisting of the 5 parts of the development process.</span>
    <li>Analysis and Research</li>
    <li>Design</li>
    <li>Implementation (Coding)</li>
    <li>Testing</li>

## Actors
A list of actors that will interact with your code base. Not necessarily a person, they are more like roles, such as an administrator, a guest, a user, or a storage medium. An admin could be a person or a robot that, say, gets rid of interoperate users automatically. A storage medium could be a database, or a monkey that you hand data and a color swatch and when you ask the monkey for a color it hands you the corresponding data.<br>
<br>
Format:<br>

`Name of actor, need basis(required, desired, optional),`

## Use Cases
Each actor needs to have a least one (and likely but not necessarily) use case. They correspond to a thing that an actor should be able to do.<br>
<br>
Format:<br>
```
Name: ...
Actors: ...
Description: ...
```

## User Story
A user story is a description of a complete, single feature that the user wants implemented, as well as how important that feature is to the user.<br>
Format:<br>
```
Name: ...
Explanation: ...
Importance: ...
```

## Conversation
A visualization of the interactions necessary for a use case between two or more actors.<br>
