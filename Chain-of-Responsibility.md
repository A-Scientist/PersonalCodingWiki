#### Need
I need to talk to an object(A), but in the case that A needs to pass work on to other objects, there needs to be a list of A, B, C, D, E, and so on. 

# Chain of Responsibility
A linked list of objects where each successive object in the list is the next one that has a chance to handle the current problem.<br>
