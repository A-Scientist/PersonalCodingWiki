# PersonalCodingWiki
Currently most of the content of this repository is in the Wiki. If you would like to a copy of the wiki, you will need to clone it as if it were a seperate repository, and as such it has a seperate repo link in the bottom right hand corner of the wiki page.

If you are trying to copy the repo from GitHub Desktop app, you may notice it gives you an error instead. You will have to initally clone the repo via the command line. In my experiance, you may then add the repo as a local repo to GitHub Desktop and then push/pull from there, although some documentation says that you will continue to have to push/pull from the command line.
