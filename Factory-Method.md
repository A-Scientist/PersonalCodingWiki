# Factory Method
A creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. *From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern* <br>

## Preceding Patterns

## Use Cases
There is no way I am understanding this correctly because of how abstract the definition that Wikipedia gives is. <br>
On the other hand, if this is just a factory, then think of it like this. You could make a sign that goes on the side of the road informing drivers of something, but there is a lot of road and other places need signs as well. Instead you make a sign factory. That way you can make a design for a sign, give that design to the factory and the factory will make you a sign that looks just like all of the other signs, metal post attached to a metal sheet, but with the design you wanted on front. In the programmers case instead of a sign, you can use something like a text box. That way you can make a list that holds how ever many text boxes you need, but with a different piece of text for each.
