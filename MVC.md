# MVC Model View Controller
A Pattern for implementing an effective human interface. It uses a layered architecture where there is, as its name implies, a base layer model that houses the back-end functionality, a middle layer view that updates show feedback, a middle layer controller that can be interacted with to provide instruction, and a top layer being the user themself.<br>
