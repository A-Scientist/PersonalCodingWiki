# Wiki MarkDown Syntax
Syntax for .md files for creating wiki pages such as this.<br> 

## Specialized pages
Page with these specific names are used for distinct purposes within a GIT wiki. For example, a page named ``home`` will always be the first to show when opening the wiki without using a link to a specific page.
- home
- \_footer
- \_sidebar

## Include a link to a page
`[ Link Name ](URL)`

```
my text <br>
on multiple lines
```
You cannot use \` withing a span of boxed text or a \`\`\` within a section of boxed text<br>
